ðŸš€ # Project Status & Enhancements Needed
|
âœ… # Current Status:
The framework is functional, but some areas require further enhancements.
Order-related tests are still failing and need investigation.
Allure report not working - Need investigation


ðŸ”§ Enhancements Needed:
Improve test stability and handle intermittent failures.
Optimize selectors and improve test data management.
Enhance reporting (Allure & Mochawesome) for better insights.
Review Cypress best practices for improved maintainability.

On the right track, but things take time! A bit more polishing, and weâ€™ll have a rock-solid automation framework for sure.
