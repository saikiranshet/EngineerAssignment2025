## .gitignore

A `.gitignore` file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This is useful to avoid committing temporary files, build artifacts, or sensitive information. Below is an example of a `.gitignore` file for this repository:

```
# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/

# Ignore log files
*.log


# Ignore environment variables
.env

# Ignore build artifacts
dist/
build/

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
*.swp
*.json
*.woff
*.woff2
*.html
*.txt
*index.js

# Ignore Cypress screenshots and videos
cypress/screenshots/
cypress/videos/
```

You can create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your repository and add the above content to it. Adjust the file as needed to fit the specific requirements of your project.
